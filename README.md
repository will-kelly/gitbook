# My ideal content development role

I lost my last writer position through a reduction in force (RIF), which meant I've been back on the job hunt. Merry Christmas to me! I have to say, I've been through many jobs and contract hunts, but this one has been a bit cathartic.

Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, I went through a postmortem to figure out what I wanted to do next. I'm looking at potential moves into more content marketing or content manager skills where I can use all of my skills and experience.

My ideal content development position includes:

* Actual writing: One of my long-simmering arguments with the technical writing profession is that people can hold the title without ever writing a single technical document. I became a technical writer to write about technology. Writing starts from a blank page, not an SME authored draft passed along to a technical writer.
* Access to technology: Nothing is worse to me than working with technical writers, trainers, and instructional designers who divorce themselves from technology and expect to have everything explained to them by programmers and subject matter experts. I enjoy getting hands-on with technology and taking pride in my self-sufficient working style. Writing about technology is one of the great joys in my life.
* Management realizes that their content needs help: Looking at some of my favorite projects, there was a confirmation by management that technical documentation efforts required the advice of a seasoned professional who could take the lead in developing technical documentation for the project.
* Access to meetings: There are times with the right group of programmers or solution architects, and a whiteboard can produce magic. I like to be a part of development meetings when teams discuss features and issues so I can get the information directly versus having to follow up with the programmers later. Mind you that isn't about taking meeting minutes.
* Flexible worksite: The ideal working arrangement for me appears to be a flexible work site when I can be in the office when needed and then work from home when I need to concentrate.
* Autonomy: My ideal work situation is working as an individual contributor embedded in a technology or corporate growth department. In this role, I serve as the "voice of the content," and I write and hold responsibility for all other documentation related matters up to and including delivery. Having a micromanager strapped to a writer's leg only works against the successful delivery of content and the writer's productivity.
* Analysis: Having documented my first web-based application in 1997 and working across such diverse industries as federal government contracting, Internet services, higher education, financial services, and telecommunications means I have a lot of experience to draw upon when figuring out new applications as both a technical writer and business analyst.
* Project management: I'm at least looking to influence the project schedule over technical documentation and have a hand in managing the Document Development Life Cycle (DDLC), including the document technical reviews. It wasn't until I didn't have ownership over the process elements in producing technical documentation did I realize how much I enjoy that part of the job.

I'm excited to see what 2020 brings me professionally. As I write this post, my job hunt has momentum, and I like what I'm seeing in the market.

What is your ideal content development position like?
